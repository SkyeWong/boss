## Currency System

### 1. Currency types
The currency system in the post-apocalyptic world could include multiple types of currency, each with its own value and uses. For example, there could be a basic currency like scrap metal that is used for everyday transactions, as well as a more valuable currency like ammunition that is used for more expensive purchases or trades.

### 2. Earning currency
Users could earn currency through completing tasks or challenges, such as scavenging for resources, completing missions, or participating in events. The bot could also offer daily or weekly rewards for logging in or participating in certain activities.

### 3. Spending currency
Users could spend currency on a variety of items or upgrades, such as weapons, armor, and supplies. The bot could offer a shop feature where users can browse and purchase items, or users could make trades with other players using the bot as a mediator.

### 4. Currency exchange
If there are multiple types of currency in the post-apocalyptic world, the bot could offer a currency exchange feature where users can exchange one type of currency for another. The exchange rate could be based on supply and demand, or set by the bot based on current market conditions.

### 5. Currency storage
The bot could offer a user account system where users can store their currency and track their balance. Users could check their balance using a command like /balance, and the bot could also send notifications when their balance changes.

### 6. Currency economy
The bot could simulate a dynamic economy by adjusting the availability and value of different currencies based on in-game events and user actions. For example, if a certain resource becomes scarce, the value of the currency used to trade for that resource could increase.
